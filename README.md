=============

An example of working with https://paymentnepal.com/ using the library: https://github.com/paymentnepal/paymentnepal-java

The application allows you to initiate a transaction and then checks its status.

For correct operation, you must register the key in the file strings.xml:

    <integer name="paymentnepal_service_id">YOUR SERVICE ID</integer>
    <string name="paymentnepal_key">YOUR KEY</string>
